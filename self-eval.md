# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

Very good. I took longer than expected to finish some assignments but I think it helped me learn how to google and how to get answers faster.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Good. I am going at a slower pace than usual to try and allow myself to take a break when I need one. Otherwise, I am better at staying focused

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

Right now, going at my own pace is nice. I am nervous about if the 6 hours of fast paced learning is going to be overwhelming at first. I guess I am curious how class is structured, do we have time to ask questions and go through the topics again if needed?
